# jammming2024

**Purpose of Project** \
This [project](https://cjp-jammming.netlify.app) demonstrates my front-end development skills. It is also intended to help me practice with React, TypeScript, and Vite (hosted on Netlify) as well as deepening my understanding of UX/UI best practices. Over time, I plan to continue adding features, refactoring the code, and improving the UX. This project is a front-end website that interacts with Spotify's api. The user, if they have a Spotify account, can create playlists and save them to their account. 

This project was completed as part of the Codecademy course [Create a Front-end App with React Skill Path](https://www.codecademy.com/profiles/carolPedersen9327983972/certificates/5c9ce0b45f1de879ebcad4fd). Although I did reference a tutorial to build the first iteration of the app, I chose to use TypeScipt and Vite to better simulate a modern production environment. I intend to continue iterating on both the design and the functionality.
